I have tried to create a local teaching assistant that teaches you based on the notes or college curricilum that you have.
I have included a sample textfile in the temp folder.

### How to run?
1. Clone the repo using git clone <url>
2. Create a folder called models
3. Inside that folder make sure to place your LLM, I downloaded a 4 bit quantized version of Llama 1.0 ,7 billion parameter version from hugging face (ggml).
4. Run the notebook in notebooks folder or app.py
