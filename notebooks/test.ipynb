      "A \"sparse index\" is an index that stores only the key-pointer pairs for the records of interest in a file, leaving unused blocks unindexed (hence \"sparse\"). An index file can be either dense or sparse. A dense index file contains the complete key and pointer information for all records in the file, thus maximizing the amount of data stored efficiently in the index. A sparse index file is much smaller than a dense index since it only stores index entries for the keys that are actually used to locate records on disk. \n",

In case of dense indexing, all the records are stored with pointers to that particular page and it occupies much more space than when using sparse index. With sparse index, only one key-pointer pair per block is kept for each record type. As an example, if you have a dictionary where you want to find out the number of times each word occurs in a sentence then you can use sparse index. A sparse\n"
